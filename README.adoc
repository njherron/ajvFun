== Overview
This is a sample project to explore the possibility of using Ajv as a schema validation tool.
There is future work that will require integration between two system so data validation is required.
The hope is that Ajv will be useful in data schema validation.

== Needs
The data passed from one app to the other will need to include type validation as well as limiting values for specific dates.
The schema validation should mirror the existing form validation for the destination of this data.

=== Keywords
Refer to this https://ajv.js.org/keywords.html[link] for more information on user defined keywords.

Keywords can be used to extend the base validation Ajv provides.
This these are a good candidate for providing the custom validation of dates we need to support our future work.
